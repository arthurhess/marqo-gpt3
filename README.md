Question: Why did England have a reformation of religion under Henry VIII?

Domain expert:

Henry VIII had been a devout Catholic in his younger years. He had defended the Pope against the Protestant ideas published by Martin Luther, a German priest. Henry VIII loved his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, however her inability to produce a male heir made him seek divorce. However, divorce was incomprehensible in the eyes of the Catholic faith. He, therefore, looked to the reformation sweeping Germany in the 1500s. This reformation pathed the way for radical church reforms, one of which allowed divorce.

In 1534, Henry used Parliament to grant the Act of Supremacy, which allowed him to annul his marriage to Catherine as it made the monarch the head of the English Church. Some sources also highlight Anne Boleyn's influence over Henry VIII, who engaged in reformist thinking. It should also be highlighted the strength of the protestant movement and the criticism of the Catholic Church's wealth at the time.
