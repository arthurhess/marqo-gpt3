# Using Marqo to power topical news summarisation

## Who am I?

My name is Iain Mackie and I am head of NLP investment at <a href="https://thecreatorfund.com/">Creator Fund</a> and previously worked in Quant trading. I am currently finishing my PhD in neural search systems at the University of Glasgow and recently won the $500k <a href="https://www.digit.fyi/next-gen-ai-assistant-from-glasgow-uni-wins-amazon-taskbot-challenge/">Alexa TaskBot Challenge</a>. 

Given my passion for startups and NLP...I could not be happier to announce Creator Fund's Â£650,000 Pre-Seed investment into Marqo. Creator Fund (European Deep Tech) is joined by Blackbird (top VC in Australia/NZ), Activation Fund (US SaaS VC), and many high-profile angels. A global start to a global journey!     

## What is Marqo?

<a href="https://www.marqo.ai">Marqo</a> is developing "tensor search for humans" that improves search relevance for multimodal search applications, while being simple to set up and scale. Whereas many current neural databases require specialised search engineers, Marqo is a simple Python API where developers can index and query within seconds. Specifically, Marqo effortlessly combines the robustness and expressiveness of OpenSearch, allowing for complex filters and lexical search, with your favourite multimodal neural search models such as S-Bert and CLIP. Furthermore, Marqo's cloud platform enables customers to pay-per-query and reduces costs due to pooled resources. They are already powering child-friendly search engines, NFT recommendation systems, and much much more! 

More than just the technology, we are backing two incredible founders. Jesse has a PhD in Physics from La Trogue, Postdocs at UCL and Stanford, and was a Lead Machine Learning Scientist at Alexa and Amazon Robotics. Tom Hamer has software degrees from Australian National University and Cambridge, and was a software engineer within AWS' ElasticSearch and Database teams. Together, they have built a team of search enthusiasts with the passion and skillset to enable developers worldwide effortless access to neural search.

Marqo's open-source Github <a href="https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo">Github</a> has reached 1.1k+ starts in 6 weeks (top 10 trending libraries). They have also launched the cloud beta that allows customers to pay-per-query and reduces costs due to pooled resources (<a href="https://q78175g1wwa.typeform.com/to/d0PEuRPC">join waiting list</a>). Lastly, they are building a community of search enthusiasts tackling different problems (<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/marqo-community/shared_invite/zt-1d737l76e-u~b3Rvey2IN2nGM4wyr44w">Slack</a>).
