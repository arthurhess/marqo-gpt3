Prompt: Title: How is the US Midterm Election going?

Date: Unknown, Website: Unknown

Background:Results are being declared in the US midterm elections, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. Republicans are likely to take control of the House of Representatives but the Senate fight is on a knife-edge.
As voters across the US wake up on Wednesday morning after the election, the results of the 2022 midterms are not yet completely clear - with officials across the country warning that elections may drag on for days or weeks. The expected delays are the result of a number of factors, including razor-thin margins between candidates, potentially contested elections, the possibility of recounts and even a likely run-off in Georgia - a key Senate battleground.
Republicans made modest gains in U.S. midterm elections but Democrats performed better than expected, as control of the Senate hinged on three races that remained too close to call on Wednesday afternoon. The Georgia U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker will go to a Dec. 6 runoff, Edison Research projected.

Prompt: Title: What happened in UK yesterday?

Date: 2022-11-08, Website: www.bbc.co.uk

News summary:
Yesterday was a historic day for the United Kingdom as the country formally left the European Union after 47 years of membership. The UK is now the first and only country to have ever left the EU.  The process of the UK leaving the EU, commonly known as Brexit, has been a long and complex one. It began with a referendum in 2016 in which 52% of voters voted to leave the EU. This was followed by a period of negotiations between the UK and the EU, during which the UK formally triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the legal mechanism for leaving the EU.  The UK then left the EU on 31 January 2020, after which it entered into a transition period during which it negotiated a new trade deal with the EU. This trade deal was finally agreed on 24 December 2020, just days before the end of the transition period.  Yesterday, 8 November 2020, the UK formally left the EU and began a new chapter as an independent country.
